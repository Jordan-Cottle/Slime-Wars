# Slime-Wars
A territorial conflict inspired by Knuckle Cracker's Creeper World.

## Created by:
*   Jordan Cottle (Programmer)
*   Corey Clay (Designer)
*   Andre Rapaso (Artist)
*   David Messenger (Producer)

## Description:
*   	Different colors of slime will spawn at spawners scattered throughout the map

*	Different colors of terrain correspond to different heights

*	Slime can spread to lower levels of terrain or to other slime easily

*	Slime must stack up to reach greater heights

*	The object of the game is to eliminate each of the other colors of slime so that only yours remains on the map

*	Slime will destroy slime of a different color

*	Slime will also destroy structures of a different color and repair ones of the same color

*	Slime is consumed when attacking other slime or structures, and when repairing friendly structures.

*	Player plays as the green slime

## Instructions:
*	Selecting #1 on the keyboard is an empty cursor, to avoid placing objects by accident

*	New spawners can be constructed by selecting #2 on the keyboard and clicking on the space you want to place the spawner on. 

*	Slime launchers can be constructed by slecting #3 on the keyboard and clicking on the space you want to place the launchger on.

*	Slime launchers can be aimed by clicking on them again once built, then selecting a target in the area outlined by a circle. They will absorb and launch slime to this area as long as they have ammo to absorb.

*	Walls can be constructed by selecting #4 on the keybard and clicking on the space you want the wall to be built.

*	Walls help block enemy slime, and are cheap, but can be overwhelmed!

*	When a new objects are placed it will be in the form of a construction site.

*	Construction sites absorb nearby slime of the same color until the cost of the structure is met.

*	The progress of the construction can be seen by how transparent the site is. The more opaque the site is, the more progress that has been made

*	When a construction site has absorbed all the slime it needs, the sprite will change to match the other objects and begin to function.

## Testing Features (AKA: Cheats):
*	You can click on enemy launchers and re-aim them. 

*	Ctrl-Shift-C Activates Testing Mode (or de-activates if already on) While active, you can:

*	Up Arrow on keyboard increases your spawners rate of production

*	Down arrow decreases enemy production rate

*	Right click adds slime to the click location, of whatever color is already there. (yes, you add enemy slime if you click on it) You add green slime to empty tiles.

*	Left click removes slime (Any slime, even yours.)

*	Press R to restart the room, wihthout triggering a win or a loss.

*	Press N to go to the next level without having to finish the current one.
