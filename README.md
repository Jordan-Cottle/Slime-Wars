Description:
    - Different colors of slime will spawn at spawners scattered throughout the map

    - Different colors of terrain correspond to different heights

    - Slime can spread to lower levels of terrain or to other slime easily

    - Slime must stack up to reach greater heights

    - The object of the game is to eliminate each of the other colors of slime so that only yours remains on the map

    - Slime will destroy slime of a different color

    - Slime will also destroy structures of a different color and repair ones of the same color

    - Slime is consumed when attacking other slime or structures, and when repairing friendly structures.

    - Player plays as the green slime

Instructions:
    - New spawners can be constructed by clicking on the space you want to place the spawner on. 

    - When a new spawner is placed it will be in the form of a construction site.

    - Construction sites absorb nearby slime of the same color until the cost of the structure is met.

    - The progress of the construction can be seen by how transparent the site is. The more opaque the site is, the more progress that has been made

    - When a construction site has absorbed all the slime it needs, the sprite will change to match the other spawners and begin to function like a spawner.

Cheats:
    - While there are no cheat codes yet, the player is also not restricted to where they can construct buildings either.

    - Spawners can currently be stacked on top of each other. This will be removed and potentially replaced with an upgrade mechanic in the final version

    - Spawners can currently be placed in locations not covered by the player's slime. In the final version construction will be limited to tiles covered in a player's slime. This 'feature' can be used to jump up to higher levels of terrain, as slime can construct a spawner in an adjacent location. Then the spawner creates slime on the higher elevation that will then 'pull' the other slime up onto the same level. This general mechanic of hopping onto higher terrain will be replaced by a more intentional system in the final version.

    - Since spawners can be placed in any location, they can also be placed in territory covered in enemy slime. Since the construction site is a structure with hp, the enemy slime will be consumed in destroying it. This can be used as a 'cheat' to remotely reduce the volume of enemy slime.
